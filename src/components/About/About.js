        <p>
          Hello! I'm <strong>Nitheesh</strong>, an <strong>Adobe Certified AEM Developer</strong> and passionate <strong>UI/UX Designer</strong> 
          with over <strong>2 years of experience</strong> in developing responsive websites and scalable web components. 
          I take pride in crafting intuitive and user-centric solutions that enhance digital experiences.
        </p>
        <p>
          Throughout my career, I’ve had the opportunity to contribute to several key projects, including:
          <strong> ITC-RightShift, HAL, BMC, Thomson Reuters, T-Mobile, ETO Sphere and Lebra</strong>. 
          My role involved working across AEM Sites, AEM Guides, and AEM Forms — delivering value in both development and support capacities.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of work, I'm a highly active and physical individual. I enjoy playing <strong>volleyball</strong>, 
          <strong> cricket</strong>, and <strong>badminton</strong>, which helps me stay energetic and focused both on and off the screen.
